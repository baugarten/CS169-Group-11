Feature: User Dashboard
  As a user,
  So that I can track my donations and campaign status,
  I would like to have a dashboard.

Background: User logged in and on homepage
  Given I am logged in as a test user
  And I am on the oneProsper homepage
  
Scenario: Clicking on username should direct to user dashboard

Scenario: Dashboard should show user profile data (name, email)

Scenario: Dashboard should show campaign status

Scenario: Dashboard should show list of donations (from the user)

Scenario: Dashboard should have link to list of farmers page (homepage) as a "Who you can Fund" button

Scenario: Dashboard should have link to page of farmers that you have been invited to donate to as "Invitation to Fund" button
